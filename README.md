# My Profile Thingymabob

Welcome to my Profile!
I'm MrMilitaryMech, a programmer from the UK. I like to make various different things with my vast amount of knowledge with programming.
Here is quite literally everything I can make:
1. Websites (w/ css)
2. Python scripts
3. Windows programs
4. Unreal Engine games
5. Roblox games
6. Roblox modules for stuff like anticheats and whatnot
7. Minecraft mods (Pretty much all modloaders supported)
8. Minecraft Bedrock addons
9. Random physical devices that do one thing and one thing only
10. I can build pcs so that's another thing to add to the list
11. Working on shaders
12. I made 3DEngine for scratch, which is basically a vertex shader
13. Chrome extensions (Made an auto-completer for sparx maths once but I've lost the files somewhere
14. Some other random stuff.

>[!NOTE]
>If I know you in the real world that isn't full of ones and zeros, You can ask me to make an app and I will do so with ease.
>Dont ask me to remake the sparx maths completer. I'm working on it, shut up.

## Projects
### My python projects used to be here, but I use visual basic for just about everything now because it can be converted into a simple setup.exe in seconds.
### Visual Basic Projects:
1. X-Axis Train deleter - Deletes all trains in all servers for [this roblox game](https://www.roblox.com/games/17117997976/x-axis-train). Owner doesn't want it shared as he forgot to IP lock the API key.
2. BT:R Remote admin panel - A remote admin panel for my roblox game that can be found [here](https://www.roblox.com/games/10448933640/Bunker-Tycoon-Rebooted-BETA). I don't want it shared as it's my panel, duh.
3. Roblox User info getter - An application that gets all known public (and some private) info on a roblox user. I would not like this to be shared as I know some people would use it for stalking.
4. 

>[!NOTE]
>When my installer is released, there won't be any need to download any of these.
