# My Profile Thingymabob

Welcome to my Profile!
I'm MrMilitaryMech, a programmer from the UK. I like to make various different things with my vast amount of knowledge with programming.
Here is quite literally everything I can make:
1. Websites (w/ css)
2. Python scripts
3. Windows programs
4. Unreal Engine games
5. Roblox games
6. Roblox modules for stuff like anticheats and whatnot
7. Minecraft mods (Pretty much all modloaders supported)
8. Minecraft Bedrock addons
9. Random physical devices that do one thing and one thing only
10. I can build pcs so that's another thing to add to the list
11. Working on shaders
12. I made 3DEngine for scratch, which is basically a vertex shader
13. Chrome extensions (Made an auto-completer for sparx maths once but I've lost the files somewhere
14. Some other random stuff.

>[!NOTE]
>If I know you in the real world that isn't full of ones and zeros, You can ask me to make an app and I will do so with ease.
>Dont ask me to remake the sparx maths completer. I'm working on it, shut up.

## Projects
### My python projects used to be here, but I use visual basic for just about everything now because it can be converted into a simple setup.exe in seconds.
### Visual Basic Projects:
1. [Text2Table Remade](https://github.com/MrMilitaryMech/Text2Table-Remade) - I remade one of my own python scripts that turns a string into a table (Seperated by each new line)
2. X-Axis Train deleter - Deletes all trains in all servers for [this roblox game](https://www.roblox.com/games/17117997976/x-axis-train). Owner doesn't want it shared as he forgot to IP lock the API key.
3. BT:R Remote admin panel - A remote admin panel for my roblox game that can be found [here](https://www.roblox.com/games/10448933640/Bunker-Tycoon-Rebooted-BETA). I don't want it shared as it's my panel, duh.
4. Roblox User info getter - An application that gets all known public (and some private) info on a roblox user. I would not like this to be shared as I know some people would use it for stalking.
5. 
>[!NOTE]
>I'm not done with this section, I've made at least 10 more projects.
### Python Projects:
1. [Discord Opera GX Promotion Free Nitro Generator](https://github.com/MrMilitaryMech/Opera-Nitro-Key-Generator) - Uses the Discord + Opera GX promo to generate free Discord Nitro keys.
2. [Gen-Z sentence generator](https://github.com/MrMilitaryMech/2023-Sentence-Generator) - Makes sentences that gen-zs can understand.
3. Curseforge Modpack Downloader [PRIVATE] - Downloads all resource packs and mods from a CurseForge modpack and puts them into folders. Used when I moved away from CurseForge
4. Github repo to installer [PRIVATE] - A program that makes another program specifically to retrieve the latest release of a github repo and shove it into a folder.
5. The everything converter [PRIVATE] - Converts a file into any other possible format of it's type e.g webp to png, png to ico etc.

### Minecraft Mods
1. [Fortified](https://modrinth.com/mod/fortified) - Adds mostly decorative industrial blocks to your game!
2. [The Un-Furnace](https://modrinth.com/mod/the-un-furnace) - Uncooks cooked items. No support for modded items (yet).

### Scratch: 3DEngine
3DEngine is a modular program for the online blocky "programming language" known as scratch. It is pretty much a vertex shader but in scratch.
