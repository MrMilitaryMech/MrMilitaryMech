## Projects

Most of my projects are stored on my PC instead of Github because of convenience. Here's a list of all of my projects:

1. 2023 Slang generator [Complete] - Uses whatever words people come up with in 2023 to create a "sentence".
2. Aimbot [Beta] - Detects humanoids and aim at the head keypoint.
3. App Maker [Beta] - Uses Tkinter to make more customisable Tkinter apps. Theoretically, You could make an app maker in the app maker.
4. Bean [Complete] - Shows Ascii art of the word "Beans". Pretty random but it works.
5. Custom 3D Renderer [Beta] - Originally started as a computer science project, this can render 3d models using turtle. Not fast or efficient but schools have no modules to deal with.

Here's what's in a project folder: IDLE shortcut, Auto-Py-To-Exe shortcut, Project data folder, Project Main file, Project ReadMe File & Project Info JSON file (For EZ Project Creator to read). This makes a new project for me!
