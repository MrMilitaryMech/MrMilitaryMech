## Projects

### Visual Basic Projects:
1. [Text2Table Remade](https://github.com/MrMilitaryMech/Text2Table-Remade) - I remade one of my own python scripts that turns a string into a table (Seperated by each new line)
2. X-Axis Train deleter - Deletes all trains in all servers for [this roblox game](https://www.roblox.com/games/17117997976/x-axis-train). Owner doesn't want it shared as he forgot to IP lock the API key.
3. BT:R Remote admin panel - A remote admin panel for my roblox game that can be found [here](https://www.roblox.com/games/10448933640/Bunker-Tycoon-Rebooted-BETA). I don't want it shared as it's my panel, duh.
4. Roblox User info getter - An application that gets all known public (and some private) info on a roblox user. I would not like this to be shared as I know some people would use it for stalking.
>[!WARNING]
>No further Visual Basic projects will be made, as it's the most useless language I have encountered.

### C# Projects:
1. RbxConnect [Private] - A wrapper for the Roblox API that simplifies responses & contains various misc. functions.
### Python Projects:
1. [Discord Opera GX Promotion Free Nitro Generator](https://github.com/MrMilitaryMech/Opera-Nitro-Key-Generator) - Uses the Discord + Opera GX promo to generate free Discord Nitro keys.
2. [Gen-Z sentence generator](https://github.com/MrMilitaryMech/2023-Sentence-Generator) - Makes sentences that gen-zs can understand.
